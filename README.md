# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **rachel todd**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon Scrollable** is an android app that **fill in description (Example: "An app that displays a scrollable list of characters from the pokemon API")**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **help, help, help**

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

I don't understand how to implement recyclerview without images. The lab was perfectly fine but I don't understand how each component works together to create scrolling text.
